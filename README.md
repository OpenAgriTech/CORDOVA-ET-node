## What is CORDOVA-ET?
The COnductance Recording Device for Observation and Validation of EvapoTranspiration (CORDOVA-ET) is a set of different components and instruments designed to record micrometeorological variables required for the calculation of evapotranspiration (ET) using the energy balance (EB) method. It has been developed by the University of Cordoba ([UCO](https://www.uco.es/)) and the [IAS-CSIC](https://www.ias.csic.es/) as part of the [SIDA-FAO project](http://www.fao.org/3/ca8794en/CA8794EN.pdf).
